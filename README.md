# npm-package

imagine you wanna create a package through a react component, in this case, I install `react` and `react-dom` as `dev-dependencies` in my-project, now any library that uses this component, needs to have react and react-dom installed, and if I put them as `dev-dependencies`, it's not going to automatically install it for them, that's good we don't want that, It would do that if we list it as `normal dependencies`, so if I had react and react-dom as normal dependencies, any project installed my component library, whichever version of react and react-dom I have listed here, will be installed automatially for them, and I don't wanna do that because there could be colliions and versions, and you never wanna have multiple versions of react in the same project, **However, we do wanna make sure, that they have `react` and `react-dom` installed, because, this is a react component library** => **to do that we use `peerDependencies`**

```js
"peerDependencies": {
  "react",
  "react-dom"
}
```

And I need a way to see the component as I'm developing, as I'm writing the code, I always wanna make sure that I see what it is I'm building, as I'm building it, so I can test it out and make sure that it's working, one way to do that is to create a new react application that simply installs this locally on my machine, so you have a react application, that you create with something like `create-react-app` and then you install this library (the libary you are building) locally on the machine, however I would have to constantly rebuild the app every single time I wanted an update and then I'd have to reinstall on the application that's ingesting this component library and it can be extremely tedious to do that, and I don't wanna to do that. Instead I want to use a tool that makes it as easy as possible for me to develop a component library, and for that I'm going to use `storybook`.

To do that first you have to install `storybook`.

`$. npx sb init`

If you read about `storybook`, it says that:

**Storybook is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, Angular, and more. It makes building stunning UIs organized and efficient.**

If you run the command `$. npx sb init`

Since, we've set up our project structure and have react and react-dom, listed as dev dependencies, when I run this command, it should detect that we're inside of a react project, and it should all work automatically, so I'm going to go to my terminal or my command line interface and I'm going to paste `$. npx sb init`.

and to run the storybook you should write => `$. npm run storybook`

**Tip: in a normal react application, the `index.js` file typically ends up being the file that compiles the entire react application and then injects it into your `index.html`, however, when you're building a react component library, there is no `index.html` file, and so you're not going to be injecting any type of application into any html files, so the job of `index.js` file inside of a react component library is very different that in a react application, for our case here what it's going to do is export all of the components that I want any application that may be use this library to be able to import, now in my case for the library that I'm building, I only want them to be able to import one component and that's the Requirement component** 

and after you made all of these, and you can see you files stories inside storybook.

Now the question is how can I build this to a dist folder, that I can then publish to `npm` => use `rollup`

**rollup: ** `Rollup is a moduule bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application`

to install rollup: `$. npm i -D rollup rollup-plugin-babel @rollup/plugin-node-resolve rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external`

as you can see here, we have `rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external` => this just ensures that we exclude any peer dependencies from our bundle, we have react and react-dom as peer dependencies we want to make sure that we do not add the react and react-dom source code to our bundle, so that babel plugin that I was talking about is `babel-preset-react`.

so `$. npm i -D @babel/preset-react`

`$. npm i -D rollup-plugin-postcss`

`$. npm i -D rollup-plugin-terser`

now to config rollup create a new file called `rollup.config.js` in the root of the project.

rollup.config.js

```js
import babel from 'rollup-plugin-babel';
import resolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';
import external from 'rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external';
import postcss from 'rollup-plugin-postcss';
import { terser } from 'rollup-plugin-terser';

export default [
  {
    input: './src/index.js',
    output: [
      {
        file: 'dist/index.js',
        format: 'cjs'
      },
      {
        file: 'dist/index.es.js',
        format: 'es',
        exports: 'named'
      }
    ],
    plugins: [
      postcss({
        plugins: [],
        minimize: true
      }),
      babel({
        exclude: 'node_modules/**',
        presets: ['@babel/preset-react']
      }),
      external(),
      resolve(),
      terser()
    ]
  }
]
```


in order to run the `rollup` I actually need to add a command to run the rollup. I need to add a script inside package.json

package.json
```js
"scripts": {
  "build-lib": "rollup -c"
}
```

then run

`$. npm run build-lib`

Now, we have library built, it's now in dist folder, we're able to develop using storybook and build using rollup. the only thing left is to publish this to the npm registery, now in order to do that, you have to have an account with the npm registery, once you have an account, you'll be able to publish your library, but make sure that your library has a unique name, so first do a search and make sure that the package you want to install does not already exist. and you can change your package name inside `package.json` file and in the top of the file you can change the `name` property.

and make sure that the `"main": "dist/index.js"` and `"module": "dist/index.es.js"`

and finally run this command `$. npm publish`

the go to your profile in `npm` and inside the packages section, you can find the package you have published.
